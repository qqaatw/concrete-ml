This section lists several demos that apply Concrete ML to some popular machine-learning problems. They show how to build ML models that perform well under FHE constraints, and then how to perform the conversion to FHE.

* [GPT-2 in FHE](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml/blob/release/1.4.x/use\_case\_examples/llm/README.md): Privacy-preserving text generation based on a user's prompt
* [Titanic](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml/blob/release/1.4.x/use\_case\_examples/titanic/README.md): Train an XGB classifier that can perform encrypted prediction for the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/)
* [Federated learning and private inference](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml/blob/release/1.4.x/use\_case\_examples/federated\_learning/README.md): Use federated learning to train a Logistic Regression while preserving training data confidentiality. Import the model into Concrete ML and perform encrypted prediction
* [Neutral network fine-tuning](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml/blob/release/1.4.x/use\_case\_examples/cifar/cifar\_brevitas\_finetuning/README.md): Fine-tune a VGG network to classify the CIFAR image data-sets and predict on encrypted data
* [Neutral network splitting for SaaS deployment](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml/blob/release/1.4.x/use\_case\_examples/cifar/cifar\_brevitas\_with\_model\_splitting/README.md): Train a VGG-like CNN that classifies CIFAR10 encrypted images, and where an initial feature extractor is executed client-side
* [Encrypted image filtering](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml/blob/release/1.4.x/use\_case\_examples/image\_filtering/README.md): A Hugging Face space that applies a variety of image filters to encrypted images
* [Encrypted sentiment analysis](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml/blob/release/1.4.x/use\_case\_examples/sentiment\_analysis\_with\_transformer/README.md):A Hugging Face space that securely analyzes the sentiment expressed in a short text
* [Credit scoring](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml/blob/release/1.4.x/use\_case\_examples/credit\_scoring/README.md): Predict the chance of a given loan applicant defaulting on loan repayment
* [Healthcare diagnosis](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml/blob/release/1.4.x/use\_case\_examples/disease\_prediction/README.md): Give a diagnosis using FHE to preserve the privacy of the patient
